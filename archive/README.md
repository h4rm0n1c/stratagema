# Archive

This folder preserves the original multi-stub Rust generator and related assets for reference.

- `rust_multi_stubs/` – Copy of the previous root layout, including `commands.txt`, build scripts, and the generator source code. Use the PNG icons in the repository root (`/icons`) when rebuilding the legacy executables.
- `workflows-archived/` – Prior CI configuration saved for history.

Use this snapshot to compare behaviors or to rebuild the legacy per-stratagem executables without cluttering the active branch root.
